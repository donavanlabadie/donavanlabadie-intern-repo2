***How does UX research influence design iterations and feature development?***

UX research allows for design iterations and feature development to be grounded in user feedback and quantified metrics. This allows for less design based solely on intuition that assumes what users might want, and instead allows designers to directly reference user needs and pain points to design comprehensive solutions. Thus, it ensures the final product is meeting needs, increasing efficiency and engagement, and yielding overall success.

***What are examples of research-driven design decisions?***

Some examples of research-driven design decisions include:

* Grouping critical features together and placing the most critical features in easy-to-access locations for users. This increases user efficiency and understanding of platforms and services.  
* The design of supermarket payment systems were established based on how cashiers interact with the payment system and with goods– the payment system, product position, and customer position were all optimized based on research trends.  
* Airbnb, a popular accommodation booking site, utilized interviews and other modes of UX research to adjust their business model to make it more accessible to users. This included increased transparency, security, and UI changes that made navigation significantly easier, overall improving the app.

***What happens when design choices ignore user feedback?***

When design choices ignore user feedback, the most apparent outcome is a negative user experience as a result. This impacts things like retention rate, brand reputation, customer satisfaction, support costs, and revenue. Any sustainable business model must take user experience into account to ensure they are meeting user’s needs, especially since more often than not, the user is the one who is keeping their business going.

***How can user research and usability testing prevent major UX failures?***

User research and usability testing can provide deep insights about user opinions, pain points, and needs. This information can then be used to rule out certain changes in confidence based on user feedback to prevent catastrophic outcomes where users feel entirely misaligned with changes. By doing research and testing, users gain a generally more positive user experience and feel more connected to designers, who are using their feedback to make informed decisions that directly benefit users.

***If research contradicts a designer’s personal preference, what should happen?***

The designer should reconsider their individual preference and proceed with an open mind. It is only natural that every designer will have a way they individually want to operate, but if it is misaligned with user needs and pains, then they should entirely reconsider their plan of action to ensure their target goal is in alignment with data produced by research.

***How can UX designers ensure that their work aligns with real user needs?***

To ensure work is constantly in alignment with real user needs, it is essential to work proactively and reactively every step of the way, constantly referencing existing data or searching out new user data, through things like testing sessions, to ensure they are aptly meeting user needs. They should also be cross referencing with their colleagues, who may be able to help direct them if they are stuck or provide insights that they may have overlooked. Ultimately, communication and collaboration is key, and designers should likely never work entirely independently.

***What risks come with relying on assumptions rather than research when designing an interface?***

Some risks that come with relying on assumptions include:

* Total disconnect between the finished product and users; user needs are not met and the overall user experience is poor.  
* Poor brand reputation or individual reputation if the designer conducted research and still went against findings that resulted in a poor user experience.  
* Accessibility issues could occur as a result where users feel unsupported by new features.  
* A negative business outcome is possible where revenue or resources are diminished as a result of damaged reputation and poor user experience.

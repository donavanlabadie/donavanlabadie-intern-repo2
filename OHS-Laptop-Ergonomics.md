***What are the risks of using a laptop without an external monitor or keyboard?***

Without using added ergonomic equipment when using a laptop, there runs a risk of injuries or hardware stress. Due to the posture that commonly occurs when operating a laptop, it can many times run the risk of causing stress on the musculoskeletal system, resulting in health complications like tendonitis, carpal tunnel syndrome, or inflammation or localized pain in the elbow, forearm, wrist, or hand. Bad posture can also cause fatigue, muscle strain, and pain after long periods of time, which can then impact the position and function of vital organs. Technologically, using an external monitor or keyboard also helps to lessen stress on hardware, as any dysfunction in the keyboard or monitor is much more easily replaced when the components are external rather than internal.

***What ergonomic equipment can improve posture when working on a laptop?***

Ergonomic equipment like raised desks, laptop stands or risers, external keyboards or mouses, or specially designed chairs and other furniture accessories can help to ensure appropriate posture when working on a laptop.

***What adjustments should be made to monitor height, chair position, and desk setup for a healthier workspace?***

To more closely monitor posture and setup when operating from a laptop, some best practices can be adopted. These best practices include:

* Using a separate monitor, keyboard, and mouse if working for long periods of time on a laptop  
* Setting the monitor height to eye level, or below if necessitated by glasses. If there is no available monitor, then adjust your laptop’s height.  
* Monitors should be an arm’s length away. If using two, position yourself equidistant from both so you aren’t twisting your neck or spine.  
* Position your keyboard and mouse on a flat surface and slightly away from the edge of the desk for forearm, shoulder, and neck support.  
* Use a footrest if needed.  
* Using wireless headsets and earpieces allow you to work and call seamlessly.

***What are some daily habits that reduce the impact of prolonged laptop use?***

Some daily habits that reduce the impact of prolonged laptop use include:

* Habitualizing ergonomic setups and accessories.  
* Elevating the screen.  
* Ensuring proper seating and seated posture.  
* Adjust desk height.  
* Avoid laptop use for long periods without moving.  
* Take frequent short breaks.  
* Stretch regularly.  
* Vary tasks.  
* Stay physically active outside of work.  
* Maintain eye care (optimizing lighting, using the 20-20-20 rule, get regular eye exams)

***What equipment changes can you make to improve your workspace setup?***

In the long-term, the main equipment changes I can make to improve my workspace setup include purchasing a raised desk or ergonomic chair. However, in the short term, more immediate changes I could make include purchasing an external monitor and keyboard.

***What behavioral changes can you implement to improve posture and reduce strain?***

Behavioral changes I can implement to improve posture and reduce strain include taking more active breaks, maintaining appropriate posture through quick checks of distance and height, and making sure not to look at screens for extended periods of time, especially before bed. This is because looking at screens before bed can greatly disrupt sleep patterns, accumulating in a way that not only negatively impacts my work ethic but also my overall health.

***How can you remind yourself to maintain good posture and take breaks throughout the day?***

I can use Focus Bear\! Focus Bear’s habits and notifications enable me to remind myself even when I forgot to set other reminders, as the easy customization features allow me to set specific days and times for reminders that would be in line with my normal working hours.

***Identify at least one piece of equipment that could improve your posture and comfort.***

An ergonomic chair is the primary piece of equipment that comes to mind. As I suffered a recent presumed spinal injury, purchasing a chair that supports my spine and works in best practice of existing remote working posture is very important and at the top of my list.

***Try using posture and movement reminders for a full workday and note any improvements.***

Posture and movement reminders made a huge difference throughout my day– they constantly caught me at bad times and allowed me to adjust bad and hunched posture that were negatively impacting my back. The movement reminders also allowed me to ensure I was not neglecting any of my bodily functions and ensured I drank enough water throughout the workday.

***Document at least one workspace change or habit adjustment you made.***

One major change I made was to be more conscientious about my posture when using a laptop, primarily the curvature of my back, so that I am no longer hunched over and leaving myself sore after finishing working.

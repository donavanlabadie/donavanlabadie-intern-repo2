***What is Agile, and how does it differ from traditional project management?***

	Agile project management is the breaking down of a project into smaller, more manageable steps or iterations, often called sprints. Each iteration has its own unique cycle that allows teams to work quickly and flexibly with a focus on collaboration and customer feedback. This is different from more traditional waterfall project management, which focuses on big bang releases. Agile focuses on smaller, continuous releases. Agile is divided between scrum and kanban. Scrum is a series of fixed-length project iterations, whereas kanban is continuous. 

***What are the core values and principles of Agile?***

The core values and principles of agile are:

* To satisfy the customer through continuous delivery of value  
* Welcome changing requirements and flexibility for competitive advantage  
* Frequent updates  
* Daily collaboration and development between business people and developers  
* Projects are built around motivated people in good environment and with good support  
* Face-to-face conversation  
* Working software measures progress  
* Agile processes promote sustainable, consistent development  
* Technical and design excellence enhances agility  
* Simplicity is essential  
* Self-organizing teams is best  
* Regular intervals of reflection

***What are the differences between Scrum and Kanban, and when is each used?***

	Scrum uses fixed-length iterations, usually called sprints, and uses four main ceremonies for structure: sprint planning, daily stand up, sprint review, and sprint retrospective. The core to scrum is the backlog, a list of features or ideas by customers and team members that the team then chooses which ones to work on next. There are typically certain roles in scrum like the scrum master or the product owner, who have more say or sway in the team's decision making. Scrum is typically used for unpredictable projects requiring flexibility or innovation, for things like new products or new technologies. The shorter nature allows for more changes to be made to ensure consistent value is being delivered to customers.

	Kanban’s visual nature and continuous development process offers itself better to longer term projects, as opposed to Scrum’s shorter iterations. Kanban is thus best suited to situations where work is continuous and constantly developing. It also works better for smaller teams that can handle complex collaboration. One of the major differences between Scrum and Kanban is also that Kanban is highly visual, using a project board with distinct columns to actively manage workflow, helping with visibility and managing bottlenecks where processes may get slowed.

***Why does Focus Bear lean towards Kanban instead of Scrum?***

	Kanban is best used for more visual processes for teams that manage complex communication, as such is the case with Focus Bear’s wide range of teams in various timezones using various means of communication. The nature of the app development process, in finding bugs and assuring there is constant meeting of customer needs, leans itself more readily to being best applicable to Kanban’s visual process, in which bugs and ideas can be contributed to the backlog visually, making it easier for all team members to see and give input on the various ideas before they are worked on. Limiting work in progress also helps to make sure teams are not divesting too many resources into multiple things, enabling operational efficiency.

***What do you think are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?***

	I think the benefits for Agile are that it’s focused on highly collaborative, flexible workloads that encourage high levels of collaboration and communication. The built in processes that enable all team members to give their input and opinions at every stage of a project seems fundamental for any project’s success. The constant delivery of both forms of Agile also seems to lend itself best to customer experience, as getting updates frequently with high levels of customer to business interactions is highly important. Kanban’s added bonuses of visualization and limitation also seem to yield amazing operational efficiency and involvement.

	However, the benefits to agile may also be the cause of some of the challenges. Particularly, this could be seen in teams or individuals that have strong resistance to change or difficult to manage approval workflows. Communication is the pillar for the success of either Agile form, and any team that may have inherent roadblocks to communication may struggle as a result. There may also be too much emphasis on inherent tools and processes, as while the clearly defined natures of both forms of agile are extremely helpful for workflow, it is highly unlikely that every business is going to function perfectly when using the workflows exactly, as every company and its members are different and function differently.

***How can Agile principles help improve your role and responsibilities?***

	Agile principles can improve my role and responsibility through flexibility and increased levels of communication, as any internship’s success is dependent on these two factors. By applying Scrum and Kanban in particular to my internship, it enables me with the tools and resources to better apply myself to content delivery through the appropriate channels of communication with my supervisor and through progress boards. Kanban’s principles of continued and fluid development also align itself well with my learning style, as constantly managing new tasks and projects according to customer needs and ideas is the hands-on experience I grow best with.

***Summarize the main difference between Scrum and Kanban in your own words.***

	The main difference between Scrum and Kanban is in their delivery. Scrum is oriented in fixed-length projects with an emphasis on meetings to develop projects, whereas Kanban has less rigidity and offers a more visual workflow with the bonus of more operational efficiency in limiting works in progress. Scrum is more beneficial for newer implementations, but Kanban is better for existing work that requires more flexibility due to user feedback or changing market landscapes.

***Identify one Agile principle you think will be most useful in your work.***

	The principle of regular intervals of reflection will make the biggest difference to my work. It is easy for me to get lost in processes and workloads, and oftentimes I find myself realizing only after I’ve completed something that I could have taken a few steps back along the way to evaluate my process and determine if there was a better way I could go about it for the sake of time and value delivery. Thus, this will make the biggest difference during my time as an intern at Focus Bear. The built in daily stand up meetings will be a great asset, as getting to communicate with my peers will also enable me other opinions on how things could be done, as I always value hearing new perspectives.

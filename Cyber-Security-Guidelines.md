***What are common cyber security threats in a remote work environment?***

	While remote working has made many jobs much more convenient in terms of the work life balance they offer, they also bring about a number of cyber security threats as the devices employees use move out of the office and into the home, away from any easy to conduct in office IT oversight. Some common threats include cyber attacks, unsecured home networks, phishing scams, data insecurity, credential theft, internal security threats, poor network visibility, and compliance risks. 

***What are the best practices for keeping your devices and accounts secure?***

	Online threats are becoming increasingly more common where individuals want to steal your information and data, so practicing online safety is essential. This can be done through keeping devices and software up to date, backing up files and devices, using antivirus software, avoiding using public WiFi, preparing for stolen devices or accounts, setting up strong passcodes, or using multi-factor authentication. All of these help to increase account and information security while working remotely to keep both the business and employee safe.

***Why is it important to lock your computer when away from your desk?***

	Locking your computer is a simple and easy habit that is effective at stopping potential security breaches. In doing so, it prevents unauthorized access by unwanted individuals who may want to harm you or your organization, protects sensitive information, reduces insider threats, and prevents accidental file sharing. If left unlocked, breaches could occur like chat sharing, data theft, system tampering, or compliance violations. 

***How should you handle phishing attempts and suspicious links.***

	Phishing attempts and suspicious links are increasingly common as more and more individuals with nefarious intentions attempt to disguise themselves as people and organizations you trust in order to gain access to your information. To handle phishing and suspicious links, you should firstly identify the source of the email or message— is it coming from the correct email address or account? If not, do not interact with it. Secondly, observe the content of the email or message itself, if it seems suspicious or unrelated to your manner of work, simply do not click anything and delete the email. If you believe it to be potentially important, alert your supervisor and ask them directly instead. Finally, make sure you report all potentially suspicious activity or emails sent to you that involve your company, and inform others to be aware of the scam so they too can be safe.

***What makes a strong password, and why should you use a password manager?***

	Having a strong password and keeping track of them is the very first line of defense for cybersecurity threats, as it significantly reduces the possibility of anyone else accessing your information. Strong passwords are long, complex using numbers, symbols, and letters, unique, and highly random. Passwords should not be reused, and that is why it is essential to use a password manager so that none are forgotten or made easier, as the human memory’s ability to memorize tens if not hundreds of unique, complex passwords is highly limited.

***Why is two-factor authentication (2FA) important, and when should you enable it?***

	Two-factor authentication is important because it adds an extra, strong line of security to prevent any hackers or unwanted individuals from accessing your accounts, as even with the right password if they are unable to access your personal device or another proof of identity then they will be unable to access your account. This allows you to be more aware of data breaches and manage and change passwords and accounts accordingly. Additionally, it adds higher levels of confidence in knowing your accounts are more secure. Two-factor authentication should be enabled for every possible account where available.

***What security measures do you currently follow, and how could you improve?***

	The security measures I currently follow are mostly listed above, including password managers, complex and randomized passwords, and two-factor authentication. I go to large lengths to ensure all of my accounts are protected and secure and ensure no passwords are reused. I could improve by better managing my current password manager, as at the moment they are not all consolidated into one manager platform and instead are spread over multiple.

***How can you make secure behavior a habit rather than an afterthought?***

	To make secure behavior a habit, it is essential to ingrain it into your daily activity, potentially by using Focus Bear. By referencing your password manager for your passwords every day when you go to log into an account, you can easily check what passwords may need to be improve, or what passwords are not already in the manager. This forces your brain to recognize this secure behavior as an important step when logging into any account. 

***What steps will you take to make sure your passwords and accounts are secure?***

	To ensure my passwords and accounts are secure, I will go through all of my existing accounts and update any passwords that may need to be made more secure, or update any passwords that I have forgotten. By consolidating all of this together and ensuring an extensive security update, it builds more security in not only my accounts but also in myself knowing that my information is now secure.

***What would you do if you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on your account?***

	If I suspected a security breach, the first step I would do would be to sign out all other devices currently accessing the account— a feature many platforms have. Then, I would change my password to something highly more secure and commit it to my password manager. After doing so, I would review any information the breach could have made susceptible, and list it so I know what may have been compromised so that I can then prepare accordingly in case the hacker attempts to use any of the information against me.

***Document one new cyber security habit you will follow at Focus Bear.***

	One new security habit I will follow during my internship will be to update any outdated passwords and ensure all of my passwords are consolidated into the same password manager.

***How do UX designers work with developers to ensure accurate implementation?***

UX designers work with developers to ensure accurate implementation through consistent, comprehensive, and proactive communication. This is because there is usually an inherent gap between a design and its technical feasibility, and thus communication is essential to ensure efficiency is optimized and there are no wasted resources spent on designing features that cannot be used. Both parties should work and meet frequently when designing new features to ensure both smooth implementation and positive user experience is the ultimate outcome.

***How does UX contribute to product decisions and roadmap planning?***

UX contributions are included in every step of product decisions and roadmap planning. Without UX in consideration, planning is primarily idealistic, as UX is the grounding factor that connects actual implementation with the targeted user. This allows UX to help decision making and roadmapping through validating hypotheses, defining value, and identifying potential opportunities. 

***What role does UX play in QA and usability testing?***

UX is inherently incorporated into QA and usability testing, as delivering a good user experience requires both comprehensive QA and usability testing. When UX is being to design a new prototype, it is important for designers to do user testing sessions throughout the experience to ensure the design is functional and reliable. QA is inherently incorporated through its testing of design functionality, as QA is the step that ensures features work, and UX ensures features deliver a good experience to the user. Thus, comprehensive communication between the two teams is essential.

***How should designers provide clear documentation and feedback to other teams?***

Documentation and feedback to other teams should be constant, comprehensive, and highly proactive. The content of clear documentation and feedback should be centered around the most critical aspects of designs, with supplementary information included as needed. Content should be a combination of text-based and visual, using resources like Figma, be aligned with project goals, link back to metrics and data, and relate back to UX user testing sessions. This combination of information, delivered consistently and comprehensively, allows for an easy path of communication and collaboration to be established between UX designers and other teams.

***How can UX ensure a smooth handoff between design and developers?***

UX can ensure a smooth handoff between design and developers by utilizing comprehensive and proper documentation alongside collaborating and communicating both proactively and retroactively during the handoff. Developers should be well aware of the UX changes before they even occur, and they should be given the opportunity to give designers feedback at multiple stages throughout the design process to ensure a smooth handoff where expectations have already been readily communicated. 

***What challenges might arise when design, dev, and product teams have conflicting priorities?***

When there is an issue of conflicting priorities, challenges that might arise include lack of consistency in the finished product, miscommunication, impacted user experience, reduced innovation, inefficiency, and bottlenecks in the work experience. It is natural that different teams will have different priorities due to every individual being different, but it is important for teams to actively communicate and collaborate throughout the entire process to ensure every parties’ needs and wants are being accommodated in the finished product.

***If a developer modifies a UX design due to technical implementation, how should a UX designer respond?***

It is unrealistic to assume all UX designs will be able to perfectly translate with technical implementation, and thus collaboration between designers and developers is essential. If a developer modifies a design without first communicating, then the immediate first step is to contact the developer and ask what changes they made to the original design, and what the technical limitations were. That way, the designer is then able to adjust their original design to consider the limitations to still incorporate their intended effects and features.

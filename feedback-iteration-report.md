***How do UX designers decide which feedback to act on?***

UX designers decide which feedback to act on through an ongoing process. Feedback must be assessed at least on a monthly or weekly basis, and should be grouped accordingly based on similar insights to find patterns, themes, and issues that will help suggest what changes to make for positive UX improvements. After reviewing insights and uncovering patterns, UX designers should review other key factors like data analytics, business goals, feasibility, and projected user impact. From there, UX designers should be able to decide what feedback to act on.

***What are best practices for prioritizing UX iterations based on feedback?***

The best practices for prioritizing UX iterations based on feedback is to use a structured approach that balances user needs and pain points with business goals. The general practice is to organize, analyze, and then act upon the feedback. Most commonly, designers will use one of the prioritization frameworks, like RICE or MoSCoW, to organize feedback and compare it with business goals to evaluate priority. They will then have to analyze the potential changes based on other factors like business alignment, technical feasibility, and resource availability before selecting what feature they will change.

***How do product constraints (business goals, development effort) impact iteration decisions?***

Product constraints play a large role in impacting iteration decisions, as if a feature is not aligned with business goals or there aren’t enough available resources, then it becomes unlikely for that feature to be heavily prioritized. It is important for designers to find the right balance between impact, effort/resources, and business alignment when deciding upon prioritization. 

***How can UX designers advocate for usability improvements in a fast-paced product environment?***

For success in a fast-paced environment, UX designers should document thoroughly, have data and evidence gathered and prepared, be able to present findings compellingly and quickly, and create prototypes and wireframes quickly for fast feedback and brainstorming. Usability improvements are essential to the success of any business, and thus should always be considered during periods of updates or changes. However, the changes may be easily overlooked in a fast-paced environment, so by UX designers already having all the necessary information compiled, it makes it much easier for teams to recognize the importance and incorporate changes into updates.

***If a UX change benefits users but conflicts with business goals, how would you approach the discussion?***

The discussion should be focused primarily around comprising and collaborating. While business goals are essential, if a change would greatly impact users in a way that would help the business in the long-term, then it should be considered. Key data like KPIs or funnel rates should be used as evidence due to their forecasting of the business’ success, and how it may change with UX edits. However, it is important to remember that business goals and objectives are to most likely be treated with a higher priority, so compromise should strongly lean towards the business, and likely requires a lengthy discussion.

***How can designers work with PMs and developers to find compromises between ideal UX and technical feasibility?***

Technical feasibility is one of the major inhibiting factors of UX development, as if an idea or concept is too challenging for developers to implement, then the entire design concept must be reworked into something that is more implementable. To reach this compromise, collaboration and communication across teams should begin early, so that designers are able to alter direction if needed based on available resources. There should also be lengthy discussions about the importance of user outcomes, trade-offs, and what data is relevant and would be impacted. Flexibility and teamwork is key to finding compromises and overall improving team collaboration.

***What are the risks of making too many small UX changes too quickly?***

Too many small UX changes too quickly can greatly affect the user experience, carrying significant risks in disrupting user familiarity and eroding trust. Too frequent changes disrupt user workflows and cognitive load, and could be more impactful for neurodivergent users who may place higher value in familiarity and trust. It also becomes difficult to measure the actual impact of any of the changes, as with too much frequency the data becomes diluted as users struggle to adjust to new features, and it also causes there to be no long-term data for study or analysis.

***Identify 8 improvements that could enhance the user experience.***

* Changing the “What do you want to achieve with Focus Bear” segment to something more manageable, like a list of common solutions people find through using the app– the box itself is very open-ended and a big ask.  
* Improving onboarding to better explain what the app has to offer and how it works  
* Some text sizes are inconsistent with the text’s level of importance, and otherwise some places have too much text. This makes it confusing to follow and a bit difficult to read. Making sentences shorter and adjusting sizing will help.  
* Inconsistent visuals also makes for a confusing user experience– following a consistent protocol is beneficial  
* Changing explanations confuse the user. Saying things would be blocked after 5PM and then again saying they’ll be blocked after 10PM is contradictory. One method should be used.  
* Takes a bit of a paternalistic approach with dialogue feeling like a master or a strict parent– dialogue should feel encouraging, but not too overbearing.  
* Not enabling notifications causes a gap in reminders or information being pushed when individuals are doing something else (like being on a call), so an alternative could be sorted out to determine how to still reach users who want to focus, but don’t want the notifications.  
* It's easy to forget what goals or desired habits you add as soon as you get to the next page, so some reminders could be nice to help remind users about what exactly they want to improve about their life through using the app.

***Consider potential business or technical constraints that might impact implementation.***

Two of the most impactful business or technical constraints impacting implementation could be the lack of resources and the lack of available talent. If there isn’t enough time or money to make large-scale changes to the app, then some features can get easily overlooked, or other critical features may take a long time to implement due to available funding. Regarding available talent, if, for example, a major UX change is needed but there is no dedicated person working on UX, then that change gets backlogged whenever someone else is able to do it. 

***Prioritise the improvements based on feasibility.***

* Altering text sizing and color  
* Fix inconsistent visuals (like changing edit pen colors)  
* Fix paternalistic dialogue  
* Onboarding better explains what the app has to offer  
* Making “What do you want to achieve with Focus Bear” into a checklist versus a text box  
* Make explanations / feature explanations (5PM vs. 10PM) consistent  
* Increased reminders about what goals were set during onboarding  
* Find a way to alert users who have notifications disabled

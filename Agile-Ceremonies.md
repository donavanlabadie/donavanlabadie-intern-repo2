***What are the main agile ceremonies, and what is their purpose?***

**Daily Stand-ups:** 

	Also known as daily scrums. These are short, 15-minute or less daily meetings to discuss progress and identify blockers. Participation while standing is encouraged to reduce meeting length.

**Sprint Planning (Scrum):**

	Held at the beginning of sprints, a scrum-specific term that is typically used to define a fixed-length event of either one month or less used to create consistency. Scrum is an interactive time-boxed approach to implementing agile. The meeting’s goal is for teams to identify what can be delivered in the sprint and how work will be achieved, and sets the entire team up for success throughout the sprint. The product owner will have a prioritized product backlog, and the group subsequently estimates the amount of required effort. The development team then makes a sprint forecast outlining the estimated level of completion, which then becomes the sprint backlog.

**Continuous Prioritization (Kanban):**

	Instead of following the pattern of Scrum where they are described as “ceremonies”, Kanban’s ceremonies are instead described as cadences, as they occur with regular frequency or rhythm. Kanban includes daily standup, replenishment meetings, delivery planning meetings, service delivery reviews, risk reviews, operations reviews, and strategy reviews. Kanban prioritizes the continuous flow of work and service delivery, emphasizing risk assessment and long-term strategy.

**Sprint Planning vs. Continuous Prioritization:**

	Sprint planning uses short-term time periods used to accomplish a set goal or make progress towards a set of goals. Continuous prioritization, however, is used in longer-term settings and is used to enable continued success of a business or organization, also emphasizing risk assessment and long-term strategy.

**Retrospectives:**

	Also known as sprint retrospectives, this ceremony is used to reflect on the work that has been completed and understand what could be done differently in the future. This is used as a tool for risk mitigation. Points of review include team dynamics, processes, and tools. Plans are then created to improve the way the team works. Typically 45 minutes long per each week of iteration of the sprint (two-week sprints are 90 minutes). 

**Backlog Refinement:**

	An ongoing activity throughout the project that reviews, clarifies, ranks, edits, and updates the product backlog to keep it focused on client value by targeting specific features and functionalities. Product owners and development teams have high collaboration in this ceremony. Used to get the highest-priority work into the next sprint.

***How do Agile teams collaborate asynchronously and across time zones?***

	Honesty and up-front communication relating to the challenges associated with distinct time zone differences is essential. In these scenarios, asynchronous communication is the norm, and time must be spent to adequately invest into the right communication tools for the job like team messaging platforms, emails, etc. Another key step is to ensure there is at least some overlap in working hours, though not necessarily on a daily occurrence, as some critical components of business infrastructure still need to run with synchronous communication. A shared calendar is one example of how asynchronous strain can be mitigated. Flexibility is essential for working with team members in other timezones.

***How do Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment?***

	Agile ceremonies foster communication through consistency and collaboration. The utilization of these two key elements strongly encourages communication and alignment through the involvement of each relevant team member. For example, daily stand-ups that are separated into subsequent team meetings allow each team member to readily contribute, given the smaller meeting sizes. This gives team members the opportunity for daily progress checks that ensure they are aligned both with the company goals and the project goals. Similarly, the sprint planning meetings help to foster communication, as all present team members have ample opportunity to voice their opinions and ideas on the task at hand. This then plays into retrospectives, where communication is the foundation and essential to the success of the retrospective meeting, as being able to openly and honestly admit mistakes and what went wrong is essential for future improvements.

***Which ceremony do you think is most important for your role, and why?***

	As an intern, I believe the most important ceremony will be the daily-stand up meetings. My contribution to the company and alignment with its mission, vision, and values is essential and should be communicated every step of the way. These progressive meetings enable me to develop better relationships with my team members, and allow me to receive continuous project checks and feedback that can help enable better performance. As mentioned in the onboarding introductory powerpoint, overcommunication in this role is key, so being able to voice my opinions, ideas, and concerns in a set meeting will be crucial to my success in this role. 

***Attend a stand-up meeting and observe how updates are shared.***

	Updates are shared succinctly and quickly, getting straight to the point, and making sure everyone’s feedback is accounted for while making sure everyone is also still aligned with their relevant goals. Feedback is given straightforwardly, which helps to clear up any confusion and make best use of everyone’s time.

***Participate in a retrospective or review past notes from one.***

	Reviewed past notes and findings from a retrospective meeting that occurred on 3rd October. Notes are brief but detailed and documents what went well, what could be improved, other ideas, and actions to be done.

***Document one change you can make to improve your team collaboration.***

	One change I can make to improve my team collaboration is to better get to know the individuals I am working with on a personal level on top of a professional level. Relationships beyond just worklife are important for not only internship success, but also my own personal success, as when I have better personal connection to the people I am working with it allows me to work more fluidly in team settings and feel more comfortable sharing my thoughts, opinions, and ideas.

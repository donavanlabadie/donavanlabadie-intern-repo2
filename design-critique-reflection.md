***What is design critique, and why is it a crucial part of the UX process?***

A design critique refers to analyzing a design, and giving feedback on whether it meets its objectives. Design critiques are crucial parts of the UX process because open feedback is essential for collaboration, communication, and overall improvement, as it is nearly impossible to improve a design without another’s input, as it helps you avoid mistakes and produce higher quality work where they think of things you may not have. Additionally, a culture of positive critiquing can help bring teams closer together as they become more comfortable sharing their honest insights and opinions, something that will overall benefit the organization. 

***What are the key principles of giving helpful, constructive feedback?***

Key principles of constructive criticism focus on being timely, specific, objective, and solution oriented. It is important to not come off too personal, as the target of the feedback is not directed at the individual, but the product they produced. It should be given in a way that is two-way and future-focused for growth, giving them the right amount of encouragement and support.

***How should designers receive and apply critique without taking it personally?***

Designers should focus on the work rather than the person, as otherwise the feedback may come across as too harsh and demeaning of someone’s character rather than communicating the objective issue you have with the work they produced. It’s essential to shift perspective into a more objective nature so that there can be an overall improvement. Key principles to follow when receiving feedback include listening first and reacting later, asking clarification questions, seeking out user-centric perspectives, looking for feedback patterns, and building confidence and humility.

***What are common mistakes when giving or receiving design feedback?***

Common mistakes when giving or receiving design feedback include being too vague, personal, focusing on solutions without explaining problems or being direct, or giving feedback with no relevant context. In doing this, it becomes easy for people to get defensive, interruptive, and failing to ask for clarification, ultimately leading to misunderstandings and damaging collaborative efforts and overall team connection.

***What is the difference between personal opinion and objective UX critique?***

The difference between personal opinion and objective UX criticism is that in personal opinion, personal feeling is taken into account rather than the actual quality and capability of the work that was produced. This is often phrased as sentences starting with things like “I feel…”, “I like…”, or “I don’t like…”, and is ultimately unhelpful for improving feedback based on established common goals. Alternatively, objective criticism is systematic and evidence-based, allowing you to neutrally discuss the work without taking personal feelings into account, allowing more overall better growth and collaboration.

***If someone gives vague feedback like “I don’t like this”, how would you get more useful input?***

In order to get more useful input, it is important to ask the right clarifying questions that guide them towards more objective, specific, and actionable delivery. This can be done through first acknowledging their response, and then asking them for their opinion on how they might improve it or asking what they find most difficult or confusing about it. It is important to react calmly and professionally in this instance, as it is possible that they did not intend for their feedback to come off as personally critical.

***How can you ensure that design critique sessions are productive rather than overwhelming?***

To ensure design critique sessions are productive and not overwhelming, it is important to remain neutral, establish a safe environment, and follow a structured process for delivering feedback. A mindset should be established that is focused on product improvement, and it is important for participants to discuss both positives and negatives of every design, as it is important to balance out negatives with positives to ensure that no one feels too overwhelmed if their product is widely disliked.

***What are low-fidelity wireframes, and why are they useful?***

A low-fidelity wireframe is a basic sketch or simplified version of a website or an app’s interface that focuses on primarily functionality rather than complete design. These wireframes include basic layout, UI elements, content placement, navigation, user flow, and annotations. Low-fidelity wireframes are useful for a number of reasons, including the fact they’re quick and easy, encourage feedback, facilitate iteration, and save time and resources. However, they also have limitations, including the lack of detail, no interactivity, and potentially over simplify certain features that may need to be more complex.

***How do low-fi wireframes help speed up the design process?***

Low-fi wireframes speed up the design process by focusing primarily on the core structure of the website or app, reducing the time spent on visuals and allowing for rapid iteration and quick feedback. This helps to prevent costly changes later by catching flaws early, saving time and budget.

***What tools can be used for low-fi wireframing?***

Tools that can be used for low-fi wireframing include traditional methods like pen and paper or whiteboards, or focused software like Figma or Balsamiq.  

***How do UX teams use wireframes for early feedback and iteration?***

UX teams use wireframes to obtain early feedback and help facilitate early prototype development. Wireframes work as easy to understand blueprints that only prioritize core features, allowing them to constantly create different draft versions, and easily send them for feedback, so that they can make any necessary changes without investing too many resources.

***How can low-fidelity wireframes help avoid costly design mistakes?***

Low-fidelity wireframes are not resource intensive, and only require very minimal time and effort to create a prototype or trial design. Thus, if something is wrong in the test design, then it can easily be fixed before being implemented into live versions. However, had there been an issue in a live design, it would take an entire team to go in and make the necessary changes when it could’ve been prevented earlier by using wireframes.

***If a stakeholder wants to jump straight into high-fidelity design, how would you explain the value of low-fi wireframing?***

I would explain the risks of investing a large amount of resources very quickly for very early stages of the design process. As most other creative processes go, it is important to first start with brainstorming and outlining critical components before investing in high-fidelity designs. This is because if something wants to be changed in high-fidelity, then it is much more cost intensive and will take longer to change than if the stakeholder wants to make an adjustment to something in a low-fi design.

***What are some common mistakes designers make when creating wireframes?***

Common wireframing mistakes include overcomplication, too advanced visuals, skipping user research, or ignoring feedback. This ultimately leads to misalignment with user needs and both internal and external confusion regarding both the decision-making and design processes.

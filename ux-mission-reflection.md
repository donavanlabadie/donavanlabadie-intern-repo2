***If a new feature looks visually appealing but is hard to use, how should UX designers handle that tradeoff?***

UX designers should prioritize the ease of usage over the aesthetics in this scenario. This is due to the fact that even if the feature is high in visual appeal, user experience will decrease as a result of it being too difficult to use. Ease of function is essential when mapping out a successful user experience, especially if it’s a critical component. If a user can’t navigate past an early feature that is highly complex, then they will never get to other critical features, and thus sell your business model short.

***How can Focus Bear’s UX differentiate itself from other productivity tools?***

Focus Bear’s UX immediately differentiates itself from other productivity tools in its being designed specifically for neurodivergent users in the way it formulates reminders, notifications, habits, and structure. Focus Bear can continue to build upon this by making the overall app more seamless to use so users can more readily discover the benefits of core features. The current core problem we are facing is high dropoff and retention rates at the beginning of app installment, meaning users are dissatisfied with the current initial user experience. However, in fixing this feature we can also find opportunities in how we can improve other critical components of the app to offer an even better user experience.

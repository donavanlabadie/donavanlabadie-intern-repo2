***What do you hope to learn from this internship?***

I am hoping to walk away from this internship having learned a number of new things that will help foster development in both my personal and professional life, both from applying myself throughout the internship and through the Focus Bear app itself. I was inspired by Jeremy’s own personal story that he’s uploaded on the Focus Bear website, and I am hoping that my experience working with and on the app will help me get a bit better control over the nuanced parts of my life that I am currently struggling with. Though in a more professional sense, I am hoping to develop my technical skills, learn the Kanban board process better, understand how successful app development comes about, and learn how to strategise for both user experience and content strategy. I believe this internship will be a great learning experience.

***What skills are you most excited to develop?***

	Primarily, I am hoping to develop my existing skills relating to customer interaction and better teamwork and collaboration with my peers. As I have already previously done an internship in consulting, I have developed some experience working directly with clients and learnt how to understand their needs, but I am hoping to further develop this skill through working with Focus Bear. This is especially important to me because the target audience for Focus Bear is neurodivergent individuals, so it would open up my capabilities to being able to aptly communicate and work for individuals who come from all sorts of backgrounds and who live all sorts of experiences. This development will also greatly improve my ability to understand others in my personal life.

***What do you think you can contribute to the team?***

	I believe I bring a relatively unique perspective to the team with having experience in game development on ROBLOX. Having done it for almost a decade now, I have my own individualized sense for how to connect with different target audiences through what products and features are shipped to meet their needs, or to fill niches in the market. Being involved with content strategy and user experience would be the perfect opportunity for me in this internship to apply these skills, and learn how to apply them in my future endeavors both personally and professionally, as currently they are somewhat standalone to my current professional history. 

***What is one area you feel less confident in that you’d like to improve?***

	Communication is the area I feel the least confident in that I would like to improve on over the course of my internship at Focus Bear. While it is a rather stereotypical one, I find that in both my personal and professional life, I have a hard time properly communicating my ideas and opinions, as even when they make sense to me, they often are not communicated the best to others. This is an important backbone to any successful internship or career, and thus I hope to learn how to hone this skill better when it comes to voicing my insights or opinions through working on various tasks relating to content strategy and writing, or relating to user experience design.

***What does success in this internship look like for you?***

	Success in this internship to me looks like showing up every day, developing a solid schedule, getting work done on time, meeting new people, and learning new skills. I believe that I am not a perfect individual, and am far from complete, so as long as I take away even one new skill, though I am sure I will take away many, I will be satisfied and grateful for my time at Focus Bear. I am also hoping to use the app to help improve both my concentration and my own work ethic so I can improve in both my personal and professional life.

***What are key UX metrics used to measure usability and engagement?***

UX metrics are an important part of being able to measure user experience, and plan out any needed adjustments or ideas accordingly. The basic key measures include success rates, time it takes to complete tasks, error rates, and users’ subjective satisfaction.

***What is the difference between quantitative and qualitative metrics?***

Quantitative and qualitative metrics for understanding user experience can also be understood as object or behavioral metrics (quantitative) and subjective or attitudinal metrics (qualitative). Quantitative metrics measure what people actually do, and are more commonly measured through immediately accessible data generated from users interacting with pages. Quantitative metrics include things like task success rate, time on task rate, conversion rate, and error rate. On the other hand, qualitative metrics are more about what people say and do, and come from things like satisfaction surveys or other routes for users to voice their opinions that then are transferred into data. This includes metrics like customer satisfaction score, net promoter score, system usability scale, and ease of use.

***How do tools like heatmaps, session recordings, and analytics dashboards help track UX performance?***

	Tools like heatmaps, session recordings, and analytics dashboards help track UX performance because they easily consolidate both types of UX data into easier to understand graphics for designers. This helps to more readily identify major pain points, system blockages, preferences, and to understand exactly how users are using your resources. This then allows you to make adjustments accordingly to better meet users’ needs.

***How can designers use A/B testing data to validate improvements?***

A/B testing is used to determine user preferences between live demo versions of a given application or resource. Most commonly, you compare the original design to a variation. In ideal circumstances, the variant should only barely differ from the original. This helps to generate feedback on one specific design instance. Once testing is done, you’ll be able to access the data and make decisions relating to that design change.

***If a UX metric shows poor user engagement, how would you determine the cause?***

If a UX metric showed poor user engagement, then I would put multiple funnels or markers into place to identify what steps a user was making around that specific metric. For example, if it was relating to how many users were manually entering tasks, I would set up markers in other related places like how many users are adding goals, habits, or using other features that require self-input, and then compare why users might choose to use one self-input feature over the other. Insights could also be gleaned from user experience interviews, as asking any users about their preferences or reasons for using the app (ie. What do you see as the main purpose of the app? What features do you use most?), could give insights as to if users are even thinking about using tasks, or if the issue lies elsewhere.

***What are the risks of relying too much on numbers instead of qualitative feedback?***

The main risk is that numbers only show one side of the story. For example, if you’re using the metrics to measure click through rate for any given button to any given page, and the numbers are unbelievably low, then you might assume users aren’t seeing the button or giving it much attention. However, it could be wholly possible that a majority of your user base just doesn’t care as much about that given feature compared to other ones. Data alone can be helpful, but it is important to study it in combination with qualitative metrics to better understand the whole picture.

***How can UX designers use metrics to convince stakeholders to invest in usability improvements?***

Metrics are able to convince stakeholders to invest because it provides statistical support for how usability changes can greatly change user experience, and thus turn profits if the change was critical. For example, one change to the initial page of the website could result in a 50% increase in downloads, thus meaning profits will in turn rise if more people are using your app. Thus, if these kinds of changes were implemented system wide, then it would generate more users.

***Identify a key UX metric that is relevant to Focus Bear.***

Retention/drop-off rate is highly relevant to Focus Bear, as the number of users who download the app and then actually continue to engage with it measures the overall success and impact of the app on users’ lifestyles and decision-making. If the rate is high, then that means something is being done right. However, if the rate is low, then something needs to be changed, and more metrics should be studied to glean the cause.

***Analyze how this metric has changed over time and consider possible causes.***

Over the last 90 days, the retention/drop-off rate has stayed mostly consistent– featuring a steep drop in users returning after the first day, becoming close to zero by day 7\. I believe that possible causes related to this could be related to the same reason users may download the app– their ability to focus and maintain discipline. Since the app targets this specific demographic of individuals, it is possible to also assume that they would struggle with constantly opening the app every day and staying on track of their habits, as that itself would have to become a habit. Another possible solution is the app not meeting the users needs, or the initial onboarding being too confusing or uninteresting to users. 

***Suggest a UX improvement that could positively impact the metric.***

Taking inspiration from other apps I have personally used, one change that could help users return to the app more frequently for usage could be the addition of small cosmetic changes that are unlocked progressively for opening the app and completing tasks. This could include visual changes to the bear, the background, or anything else from text color to page layouts.

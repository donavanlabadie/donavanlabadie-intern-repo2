***What common UX barriers affect neurodivergent users?***

Common UX barriers affecting neurodivergent users include sensory overload from complex layouts and intense visuals, ambiguous language or labels from buttons with no context, lack of control from real-time interactions, or unclear form expectations.

***How can predictability, clear feedback, and reduced distractions improve usability?***

Predictability, clear feedback, and reduced distractions improve usability through increased user confidence, increased efficiency, easier understanding, and streamlined task completion. Predictability helps to reduce cognitive load, build confidence, and improve workflows. Clear feedback helps to give positive confirmation on task completion, guides correction and decision making, and increases transparency and overall understanding. Reduced distractions makes features easier to use, reduces cognitive load, improves focus and efficiency, and makes users feel more comfortable.

***Why do overly complex interfaces cause issues for people with ADHD?***

Individuals with ADHD may struggle with complex interfaces due to how their brain processes stimuli differently due to structural and functional differences. This results in being more susceptible to things like overstimulation where their brain gets overwhelmed and they struggle to stay focus on any one task. Complex interfaces are an example of this, as they can cause issues regarding attention and focus, sensory processing, information processing, and readability. Interfaces must be designed with accessible features in mind to accommodate neurodivergent users.

***What are some real-world design examples that improve accessibility for neurodivergent users?***

Real-world design examples that improve accessibility include:

* Sensory-friendly or quiet hours in many public spaces like supermarkets or public pools for individuals who are more susceptible to sensory overload. This also includes things like dimmed lights or reduced announcements to improve accessibility.  
* Clear and consistent signage and patterns, and an example of this is the consistency seen in road signs, using colors like blue, green, or brown for various specific categories to facilitate understanding.  
* Quiet rooms in public buildings like libraries or airports to help reduce stimulation.  
* Self checkout machines with comprehensive visualization.

***How can Focus Bear’s design choices make tasks easier for neurodivergent users?***

Focus Bear’s design choices can make tasks easier for neurodivergent users through the use of consistent aesthetics, ease of navigation, limited unexpected sensory information, and simple feature design with options for complexity. This allows users to feel a stronger sense of control and streamlines their usage of the app, so that they can focus on the one thing that matters— getting their lives back on track.  

***If a feature is technically useful but cognitively overwhelming, how should it be redesigned?***

In this case, the feature should go back to the UX team for redesign, taking feedback into account and developing prototypes based on both team ideas and user suggestions. Ultimately, the feature should prioritize reducing cognitive load, potentially removing unnecessary components while keeping the core functionality the same. This is because if a neurodivergent user is constantly finding difficulty in using the feature due to high cognitive load, then they are unlikely to reach the other parts of the feature that may also yield benefit, as they may be inclined to stop using the feature due to it being overwhelming.

***What are some small UX adjustments that can significantly improve user experience for neurodivergent users?***

Small UX adjustments include things like faster load times, consolidated menu options, varying options of complexity, and relevant context when needed to prevent uncertainty and improve confidence. This overall improves the experience for neurodivergent users and allows the entire process to be more efficient and understandable, encouraging them to continue using features.

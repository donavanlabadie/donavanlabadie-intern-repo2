***What are Focus Bear’s design priorities?***

Focus Bear’s design priorities are centered around making the app accessible and easy to understand for neurodivergent users. Made by and for neurodivergent individuals, Focus Bear’s purpose is to help reenable control over aspects of users lives that they struggle with as a result of their neurodivergence, including management of bodily functions and time. To accomplish this, there is a simple yet comprehensive interface to facilitate efficiency while also offering options and alternatives for users who desire increased flexibility.

***How should UI elements, colors, and typography support neurodivergent users?***

UI elements, including elements, colors, and typography, should be consistent and simple to help support neurodivergent users. This overall reduces the cognitive load required to perform functions and access key features, as the more simple the features become, the easier it is for users to access and understand their benefits. Issues with things like low readability or using too many fonts or colors can greatly impact a user’s experience, making them less likely to either return to your experience or to use it any further in general once they experience a design flaw.

***Why does consistency in navigation and interaction patterns matter for usability?***

Consistency matters in navigation and interaction patterns because of user’s innate expectations for features and services. They don’t want to wonder if different things are related or offer the same features, something that also goes beyond just immediate experience features, and instead can also be seen through features and icons that are mostly universal, like the cog wheel for settings or the three lines to open menus. By ensuring consistency in navigation and interaction patterns, it overall greatly increases cognitive function, learnability, efficiency, and accessibility, leading to a much more positive user experience.

***How can small UI details improve or harm usability?***

Small UI details are crucial to an overall user experience, but there exists a fine line between improvements and harmful details. Small UI details can greatly improve feedback loops, reduce cognitive load, guide user attention, and improve accessibility. They can make the overall experience feel more complete and cohesive. However, small details can be harmful if they result in visual cluttering, inconsistent design, poor readability, or impact accessibility to essential functionality. Thus, while small UI details are crucial, there runs a risk in how they could actually reduce accessibility for users.

***How can Focus Bear offer a minimal, distraction free UI while still offering powerful features?***

Focus Bear can follow a simple yet effective UI system that aptly blends aesthetics and function. This includes ensuring the visibility of critical features, like distraction blocking, while maybe hiding features that some users don’t find as relevant for their needs, but allowing for easy enablement if users so choose. Minimal UI also encompasses consistency through fonts, colors, and patterns to make the entire aesthetic cohesive and easy to understand for users. In regards to small UI details, Focus Bear could make minor features invisible unless a user enables them, and could only make small UI details and features visible when deemed important for the user experience.

***If a design change improves aesthetics but reduces usability, how should UX handle it?***

UX should handle the intersection of aesthetics and usability through extensive testing, skill, and existing knowledge of the consumer market. It is important to know the degree of tradeoff that users will tolerate before it impacts their experience, as if the change is deemed critical for an aesthetic change that also helps improve overall UX in consistency, then UX can adjust changes accordingly. However, if a change is deemed too drastic or the UX team is uncertain of how it may impact users, then feedback reports or user experience testing could be held to get firsthand experience from a user on how they would like it changed to better accommodate them and their needs for the feature.

***What are the risks of overloading users with too many choices or settings?***

Risks related to overloading users with too many choices or settings most readily impact cognitive load for users, especially so for neurodivergent users. If a user has too many choices outright, then they may struggle to make a decision and in turn choose to use a different app that offers them more guidance and support. The same goes for critical features, as it is easier to introduce users to new features one a time rather than overwhelm them with multiple all at once.

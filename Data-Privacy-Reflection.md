***What are best practices for handling confidential data?***

	Some best practices for handling confidential data include encrypting sensitive files, managing data access, physically securing devices and paper documents, managing data acquisition, managing data utilization, and managing devices. This ensures confidential data remains secure and is handled properly for the safety for all users and the organization.

***How should you respond to a suspected data breach or accidental disclosure of confidential information?***

	Each response to a data breach needs to be tailored to the specific incident’s circumstances, as there is no one way to respond to all data breaches, but action can follow four key steps: contain, assess, notify, and review.

* **Contain:** Once a data breach has been identified, the immediate first step is to contain it and to limit the breach or sensitive information.   
* **Assess:** Assessment should be conducted to identify risks posed by the data breach and how they can be meaningfully addressed. The assessment should be conducted as fast as possible. All data should be gathered about the breach, so that the impacted individuals can be identified and if they should be notified.  
* **Notify:** Notification can benefit both the entity and individuals affected by a breach, but the challenge comes in deeming when it is appropriate to disclose to an individual that their data has been breached. For example, low risk breaches may only cause unwanted anxiety, and can desensitize individuals to more critical breaches. Effective breach response considers both organizational and individual wellbeing.  
* **Review:** Reviewing is the final step in a breach process, where you can review and learn from the incident to improve information handling practices.

***What steps can you take to ensure you handle data securely in your daily tasks?***

	In order to ensure data is being handled securely in my daily tasks, I can ensure that I am only using safe and familiar networks, not leaving any data accessible while I am away from my laptop, ensure that it is not possible to accidentally share any user data with anyone outside of Focus Bear, and to safely and securely use tools and resources to where I am not uploading anything confidential to these platforms.

***How can you store, share, and dispose of sensitive information safely?***

	Sensitive information can be stored, shared, and disposed of safely through proper encryption, strong access controls, shredding of any physical documents, secure data wiping, and limiting access only to the required individuals.

***What are some common mistakes that lead to data privacy issues, and how can they be avoided?***

	Some common mistakes that cause data privacy issues on a personal level include failure to encrypt data, poor password management, poor data handling, or neglecting third party risks. These can mostly be handled by increasing education and awareness about safe data practices so that individuals are more proactive about the safety and management of their data. Organizational mistakes involve selecting inappropriate legal basis, failure to maintain records of processing activities, not prioritising training, believing in a one-size-fits-all approach, and believing compliance with one regulation equals compliance with all. To fix this, resources must be invested into the ample protection of critical user data, ensuring comprehensive coverage so that data is properly secured and managed, and that other employees know how to correctly manage any data they might experience.

***Identify at least one habit or practice you can adopt to improve data security in your role.***

	To improve data security in my role, I can make sure to comprehensively educate myself about all of Focus Bear’s existing data security measures relating to UX, so that when I am referencing any existing user data sources or examining data trends, I am ensuring that I am handling the data properly and securely.

***Document at least one key learning or security measure you will implement.***

	One measure I will implement in my personal life is to increase the rate of encryptions I use. Generally, I do not use many encryptions on any of my files or emails, but knowing that such an easy step can add strong levels of security to my data will encourage me to build this into one of my key data security habits.

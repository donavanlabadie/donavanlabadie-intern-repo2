***What’s the difference between a low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototype?***

A low-fidelity prototype only have the most critical components of a design, and usually lack functionality. They are typically wireframes with no actual visual features like colors or fonts, and only feature rough outlines of where things like buttons or images would go. They are used to make quick designs in response to feedback early in the development process. High-fidelity prototypes on the other hand have nearly full-fledged functionality, including interactable features, fully developed visuals, and they are used much later in the design process before cementing in finished products for final rounds of testing. The main differences come from when in the development process they are used and the level of depth.

***How do colors, typography, and spacing impact usability and accessibility?***

Colors, typography, spacing, and other visual elements of designs play a large role in the overall accessibility of a feature or product, as making sure they are accessible to different kinds of users can increase the overall usability while making them too complicated could potentially discourage entire groups of users from wanting to interact with your product. For neurodivergent users, visual designs with too much overstimulation, over complexity, constantly changing colors and fonts, or too much text too close together makes it difficult for them to extract as much value as they’d like to out of critical features due to their being more susceptible to being overwhelmed from poor user experience design. 

***What are best practices for animations and micro-interactions in Figma?***

Best-practices for animations and micro-interactions in Figma are to keep them short, purposeful, efficient, consistent, and smooth to ensure the best user experience. When designing micro-interactions, it is important to focus on the core features, functionality, and consider what the end goals are for any given interaction. Using built-in features like Smart Animating can also be resource efficient and help save on time. Finally, testing should be done often to ensure the feedback loop for users is to their liking and to ensure that the best possible user experience is being delivered.  

***How do UX designers ensure high-fidelity designs align with brand guidelines?***

The first step UX designers take to ensure designs align with brand guidelines is at the beginning of the design process where they take care to establish a solid foundation and constantly reference brand guidelines while developing early wireframes and prototypes. A best practice to ensure this alignment is to reference considerably often regardless of the step in the design process, as all features and functions must relate back to the overall brand image and guidelines to ensure overall consistency in the user experience. Collaboration is also highly important for this reason, even including those who may not be in the immediate development process for a given feature, as those outside of a project are able to give a unique perspective with their feedback that helps to reinforce alignment with the brand.

***How can a high-fidelity prototype help developers build the final product accurately?***

A high-fidelity prototype gives developers and designers a highly detailed, interactable, and editable version of a planned product or feature that allows them to test and consider changes without having to invest large amounts of resources. This ultimately streamlines the development of the final version, as developers are able to quickly reference the prototype to see how certain components should function and how features are intended to work, saving them time and resources that they would otherwise have to spend figuring it out if they were only given something like a wireframe.

***What are the risks of focusing too much on visuals before usability is validated?***

The major risk of focusing too much on visuals before usability is validated is a waste of resources. By investing too far into designs or idealized features and skipping the actual technical implementation, precious time and money is spent on visual features that may need to be entirely scrapped if the feature cannot be implemented. It may also risk not actually improving the user experience, as overcompensating on visuals could easily run the risk of overcomplicating and oversaturating features with visuals that may be unneeded and inaccessible.

***How can small details like button states, hover effects, and transitions improve the user experience?***

Small details like button states, hover effects, and transitions improve the user experience by offering intuitive and smooth small details that help to improve the visual feedback and stimulation when a user is using a product or service. Having well-designed small details can make a large difference in a finished product through increased responsiveness and engagement.

***Review Reflections***

Moving from low-fidelity to high-fidelity was quite the large step. Going from rough drafts and wireframes to full-fledged designs felt both challenging and rewarding, and it was nice to see my ideas be developed and in line with the app’s design principles. Getting feedback on my prototype was also very rewarding and inspired much reflection. While I had thought my first draft was in a comfortable spot, I did not realize at the time that there was still much to be done, and that is something I have continued to learn through the development process– there can always be one small change that makes a design just a bit better, and nothing is ever perfect right out of the gate. I had to make adjustments to button colors, design thematics, and make sure the theme matched the current app’s theming.

***Feedback, changes made, and how they relate to Focus Bear’s design principles.***

Specifically, my major changes were visual, with some further implementation to meet features specific to certain variants of the app, like the low-friction return nudge. In my first version, I had a very rough draft and sketch of Focus Bear, inconsistent button colors, and I was missing variations for the different friction modes, and this was the feedback I received. This was all updated in my high-fidelity version. In updating to high-fidelity, I also removed an extension to the quit window that would ask why users are quitting the app, as Jeremy said that we likely did not need it since we already had enough data. He also gave me his preference for which low-friction return nudge to use, being one of the bear peeking over the side of the monitor window. Additionally, he said that the language could overall be more cheeky and fun, to match the rest of Focus Bear, which was another change I made.

***How changes were implemented based on feedback***

Changes were made in alignment with received feedback and with reference to existing Focus Bear features to ensure alignment in critical areas. I referenced the Focus Bear color guide and used better stand-in visuals for where I used Focus Bear. Language and text length was also changed accordingly.

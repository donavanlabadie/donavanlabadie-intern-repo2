***What are best practices for conducting user interviews?***

Best practices for conducting user interviews involves thorough preparation through clear goals and selecting the correct participants, being friendly and building rapport, asking open ended questions, active listening, recording sessions if permitted, and focusing on the information at hand rather than future hypotheticals. It is important to spend the interview prioritizing the understanding of the user’s motivations and pain points when they are interacting with a product, feature, or service. 

***How do you run an effective usability test without influencing the user?***

The goals of usability testing include identifying problems, uncovering opportunities, and learning about the target user. To conduct the test without influencing the user, it is important to remain open minded and highly observational by applying specific techniques. Observational techniques to utilize during a usability test include thinking aloud, remaining a neutral facilitator, or asking non-biased probing questions.

***What types of questions should UX designers ask during interviews?***

Questions that UX designers should ask during user interviews should be primarily open-ended and behavioral, focusing on goals, habits, pain points, and motivations for their behavior during the test. Specific examples of questions could be:

* How did that page make you feel?  
* What motivated you to click that series of buttons?  
* What did you like about that page?  
* What is the goal you are trying to achieve using this feature?

***How can recording and note-taking improve research accuracy?***

Recording and note-taking improves research accuracy by causing the researcher to rely less on memory and prevents potential bias or cognitive issues that could impact the research. It allows for researchers to directly reference interviews, studies, or direct quotes that can help them make a more meaningful, data-driven decision.

***What are common mistakes to avoid when conducting user research?***

Common mistakes to avoid when conducting user research involve avoiding leading questions, bias, and lacking clear goals. These all lead to skewed results that could greatly impact the final product. As a result, it is important to follow best research practices like unbiased questioning and defining clear objectives to ensure the project and research does not run askew.

***If a user struggles with a feature during testing, how do you know if it’s a UX problem or a learning curve issue?***

You are able to determine whether a problem is being caused by a learning curve or a direct UX issue by carefully observing user behavior and feedback, and then considering it in relation to other gathered information and data. If the data trends with other research or interviews that have already been conducted, then there is a possibility of it being a UX issue rather than a learning curve issue. However, there is a possibility for it to be both if the product or feature does not provide enough support for the user.

***How can UX designers ensure they don’t influence user responses during an interview?***

To do this, UX designers must stay observational and non-biased. They should focus on neutrality and only ask probing questions where necessary, allowing the user to experience a product or feature and give their complete, open-minded feedback.

***What’s the best way to document usability testing results so they are useful for design decisions?***

The best way to document testing results is in a comprehensive yet clearly organized document that allows for quick navigation and discovery from anyone who uses it in the future. It can be beneficial to focus on prioritizing reports and findings based on critical discoveries and actionable insights. Other structurally relevant points include grouping findings, linking issues with evidence, and offering a variety of small and large suggestions at various points based on findings.

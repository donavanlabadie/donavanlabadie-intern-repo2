***What are the core features of Figma, and how is it different from other design tools?***

Figma is one of the most popular UI/UX design tools, and is primarily used for prototyping and collaboration. It’s an entirely web-based tool, working directly in a browser and not requiring any downloads. Figma’s top features include auto-layout, smart selection, scaling, variants, real-time collaboration, UI kits, plugins, and templates. These are also the main differentiating factors compared to other design tools, though the primary differentiating features are the browser-based nature, powerful real-time collaboration, and built-in prototyping.  

***How does Figma support collaboration between designers, developers, and PMs?***

Figma primarily supports collaboration through its cloud-based platform with its features designed for real-time collaboration. These features include real-time co-editing, comments and feedback, dev mode, centralized design systems, and interactive prototyping. This allows for all members of a team to actively work together in real-time, or leave feedback, ideas, and prototypes for the other members of the team to review when they begin their working hours.

***What are components, variants, and auto-layout, and how do they improve design efficiency?***

**Components:** Components in Figma are reusable UI elements for consistency, like buttons, icons, and navigation bars. They help to improve design efficiency through wide-spread update functionality, enabling easy consistency.  
**Variants:** Variants are different versions of states, sizes, and colors, of a single component, grouped together. These are essentially component libraries, organizing them into one place to reduce clutter and improve functionality and efficiency.  
**Auto-Layout:** Auto-layout automatically arranges elements with spacing, greatly speeding up changes and handling dynamic content without having to reposition manually.

Overall, all of these features are great time-saving devices.

***How do you share and hand off designs to developers using Figma?***

Sharing to developers in Figma can be handled through either inviting them as viewers or by using dev mode for detailed inspection and hand-off. Context can be provided through comments, prototypes, annotations, or real-time demonstrations. Dev mode enables an easy hand-off, as any asset is easily exportable from dev mode, and code connect can be used to link components to their code when exporting.

***How would you organize a design system in Figma to ensure consistency?***

Firstly, establish a shared language and library of reusable components, as this ensures consistency, improves efficiency, and increases time that can be invested into other features. It is important to lay the groundwork properly and prepare your team for success. Take inventory of what’s available to you. It is important to consider existing UI and other available assets, even including code, to give you a better idea for what can be done quickly and be standardized with other pre-existing components.

Secondly, define foundations, or the theme, that you can reference back on throughout the design process, including elements like color, accessibility, font, etc. It is important to choose components and elements that are accessible, consistent, readable, and stylistic. There are plenty of available tools to ensure visual harmony and ensure overall theme consistency.

The third step is to build the actual design system in Figma. This includes both aspects of steps one and two, but also key decisions like naming consistency and organizational strategy. It is extremely important to maintain planned thematics and ideas throughout development to ensure overall cohesiveness. 

***If a developer needs details about a design component, how would you provide that using Figma?***

This can be provided through comments or annotations, both easily accessible to viewers in either the base viewing mode or dev mode. If they are enabled as a collaborator, they could leave comments or annotations themselves that the UX designer could then message them about or respond with their own comments or annotations.

***What challenges might arise when collaborating in Figma, and how can you avoid them?***

Common challenges that might occur in Figma could include miscommunication or overlapping work. Miscommunication is particularly problematic, as Figma’s collaboration is dependent on the amount and frequency of communication. However, if two individuals are working on the same project with their own independent ideas, and are not communicating with one another, then there could quickly be issues where there’s high levels of inconsistency or decreased efficiency. Miscommunication may also be a problem seen through comments, as without tone that could be conveyed in-person, it is possible to misinterpret the intention behind messages.

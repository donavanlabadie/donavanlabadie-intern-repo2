***What are the two main types of UX research?***

The two main types of UX research are qualitative, understanding why users feel or act, and quantitative, which uses data to measure and analyze. Qualitative focuses on deep insights pulled from things like user testing sessions, where users explain how specific features made them feel, whereas quantitative uses numerical analysis from things like surveys or website analytics data.

***What are common UX research methods?***

Common UX research methods include usability testing, user interviews, surveys, A/B testing, field studies, analytics, and focus groups. These methods are used to glean insights from users and help test hypotheses or new features/prototypes, overall helping to guide the design experience.

***When should you use observational research vs. self-reported feedback?***

The difference between using observational research and self-reported feedback comes down to the research goals and the desired information. 

**When to use observational research**: Observational research is best used in settings when seeking out actual, unconscious information, and when there may be a discrepancy between what individuals may say versus what they do. 

**When to use self-reported feedback**: Self-reported feedback is often used to gather insights about highly subjective or personal experiences, like motivations, opinions, or pain points. This research method is also inexpensive and can reach more participants faster than observational research through things like surveys.

However, the best practice is to use a combination of both research methods to gain ample amounts of qualitative and quantitative data for the best insights.

***What are the benefits and limitations of remote vs. in-person UX research?***

Remote and in-person research both come with their own benefits and limitations depending on what kind of information wants to be gathered and what resources are available.

**Remote Research:** Remote research benefits include cost-effectiveness, wider reach, real world context, and easy scalability. Limitations include contextual limitations relating body language or emotions, technical issues, less control, or increased participant variability.

**In-person Research:** In-person research benefits include detailed information about context and cues, deeper rapport and connections, a controlled environment, and hands-on interaction. 

***What is the jobs to be done framework? What are the different types of user jobs?***

The jobs to be done framework is a product development process based on understanding the customer’s goal, or “job”, and the thought processes that would lead a customer to “hire” a product to complete the job. This framework is used when a team is attempting to discover what users are trying to accomplish or achieve when they buy a product or service. This framework is used to focus more on the customer than the product.

Specific user jobs primarily fall into three primary categories:

**Functional:** Core, practical tasks users need to accomplish.

**Emotional:** How the user wants to feel when performing the job.

**Social:** How the user wants to be perceived in social circles as a result of their job.

***If Focus Bear wanted to improve its onboarding experience, which UX research methods would be most useful?***

For Focus Bear to improve its onboarding experience, it should use a combination of UX research methods to get the most beneficial outcome. Research methods in particular could include usability testing, user interviews, behavioral analytics, or surveys. Through combining these methods, Focus Bear can obtain a strong subset of both qualitative and quantitative methods, allowing them to make stronger, data-driven design decisions to greatly improve the user experience.

***What are the “jobs to be done” for Focus Bear users?*** 

The jobs to be done for Focus Bear users are as follows, as fits into the three primary categories:

**Functional Jobs:** Starting tasks when they feel stuck, protecting their focus, creating structure, and building consistent habits.

**Emotional Jobs:** Reducing self-criticism around productivity, feeling more in control, increasing confidence, and making productivity and discipline feel appropriate and calm.

**Social Jobs:** Meeting external expectations in university, jobs, relationships, etc., or helping them find more outlets for proper support.

***What challenges might arise when collecting self-reported user feedback?***

One of the major challenges that might arise from collecting self-reported user feedback has to do with bias. Bias could occur for any number of reasons, but in particular for self-reports could pertain to users feeling frustrated with a specific feature so amplifying their emotional response, or their not being entirely truthful due to the manner of reporting, if for example they are publicly sharing their opinion they may not want to be too negative. Other issues that may occur include lacking self-awareness, interpretation issues, or memory issues.

***How can UX designers avoid bias when conducting research?***

UX designers can work to avoid bias when conducting research through how they conduct studies, including the use of neutral language, diversifying participant pools, challenging assumptions, randomizing questions, and employing mixed-method research. While there will always be some degree of bias with sampling human participants, utilizing these resources helps to limit it, making the data more useful.

***How do PMs decide which UX improvements to prioritize?*** 

Project Managers (PMs) prioritize UX work on the basis of balancing user needs, business goals, technical constraints, and data, and often use frameworks as a tool to do so. Some of these frameworks include RICE, MoSCoW, or Kano. These help PMs to structure what is most important to fix, and allows them to focus on high impact and low resource solutions first while also roadmapping what other changes will come next.

***What factors influence prioritization?*** 

Prioritization is typically based on user needs, business value, accessibility, strategic alignment, opportunity cost, and stakeholder input. However, this list is not exhaustive, and there are also many other smaller factors that may be highly relevant depending on the situation. Ultimately, every needed UX change is different, and thus requires differently weighted considerations when prioritizing changes.

***How can UX designers make a strong case for usability improvements?*** 

In order for UX designers to make a strong case for usability improvements, they must be able to ground their suggestions in user feedback, data and analytical support, and other evidence gained to be able to explain and quantify the importance of a change and how it might be able to impact and improve the business. While UX is not as technical as developing, it is still essential in the development, function, and success of any product or service. This is because if there is a poorly offered user experience, for example in an app’s onboarding process, then many users will quickly grow disinterested in a function or service, and thus may never actually discover other key features the app has to offer, limiting the effectiveness of both the app and other roles.

***What frameworks help balance UX work with feature development? (e.g., RICE, MoSCoW)*** 

Key frameworks that help balance UX works and feature development include RICE, MoSCoW, Impact vs. Effort, the Kano Model, and Opportunity Scoring.

* **RICE:** The rice framework evaluates the balance on the basis of reach, impact, confidence, and effort. **MoSCoW:** Determines the balance through considering must-haves, should-haves, could-haves, and won’t-haves.   
* **Impact vs. Effort:** Plots UX work and other features on a 2x2 grid to evaluate both their estimated impact and effort to determine what opportunity is most advantageous.   
* **Kano Model:** Classifies changes through expected functionality, performance, and delighters.  
* **Opportunity Scoring:** Weights each initiative based on importance and expected level of satisfaction.

***If a PM tells you there’s no time for a UX improvement, how would you respond?*** 

I would explain to them the importance of UX improvements and support it with relevant evidence. Evidence is important both for the current project and for explaining to the PM how UX changes have positively impacted the business in the past. It is also important to remind the PM that UX is one of the first things users encounter, so UX changes could actually make a large difference in the overall success of an update or change and should thus be prioritized accordingly.

***How can UX designers ensure that important usability issues don’t get ignored?*** 

In order to ensure that important usability issues don’t get ignored, it is important to use strong evidence, determine the expected impact, document thoroughly, and communicate convincingly. Through this approach, the data and reasoning likely becomes too difficult for others to ignore when considering what changes should be made, as it quantifies the impact of UX in an easily understandable and traceable manner. Ultimately, usability issues should be treated on the same level of severity as other major bug fixes or quality of life improvements.

***What’s the best way to present UX work as a business priority rather than a "nice-to-have"?*** 

The best way to present UX work as a business priority is to show evidence. This includes both past evidence where UX changes have made positive impacts to the business, or evidence where user feedback is relating to UX issues or changes that should be made to improve things like accessibility, understanding, and the overall user experience. UX is critical to the function of any product or service.

***Who are considered vulnerable populations, and what challenges might they face in digital spaces?***

	Vulnerable populations are those at an increased risk of suffering from health problems or disparities. This includes individuals like the very young or very old, individuals with chronic illnesses, disabilities, or communication barriers, veterans, minorities, lgbtq, individuals with chronic mental health disorders, etc. These populations are at an increased likelihood of suffering from physical or mental illnesses, and have lesser access to healthcare. 

Furthermore, the advent of technology and rise of digital spaces has seemingly only exemplified the disparities vulnerable populations already experience. Vulnerable populations in digital spaces may struggle with digital literacy, inadequate privacy safeguards, harmful content, lacking user-friendly design, languages, and prioritization of profit over wellbeing for digital workers.

***What ethical considerations are important when designing or working with neurodivergent individuals?***

	Ethical considerations when working with neurodivergent stem from the fact that they process sensory and technical information different from neurotypical people, and this factor must be taken into account when designing spaces or working with neurodivergent individuals. Considerations that could be made include policies and procedures, the built environment, and individual adjustments. Changes to policy and procedure could be things like changes in options or the amount of control individuals have, as individuals are then able to adjust their working style and space to what suits them best and makes them most comfortable. Adjustments to the built environment may incorporate quieter spaces that support more concentrative, focused work. And finally, individual adjustments, in ways of things like programs or tools, can help empower individuals with the resources that bring out their skills best, including changes in meeting modes or the ability to work remotely.

***How can you make interactions and content more accessible for people with ADHD or Autism?***

	For neurodivergent individuals, doing things like navigating websites, understanding content, or completing tasks online can be more challenging, so it is important to adjust the accessibility of content to be better available for these audiences. The basis of adjusting content for neurodivergent individuals also has a positive effect on neurotypical audiences, additionally enabling them with a better user experience. Ways content can be adjusted to better support neurodivergency include:

* Using clearer, simple language  
* Breaking content into smaller chunks  
* Using descriptive headings  
* Providing text alternatives for images  
* Using high contract colors  
* Allow users to control audio and video  
* Avoid auto-playing media  
* Provide captions for videos  
* Use a consistent layout  
* Offer flexible time limits  
* Give options to access content  
* Using more readable fonts  
* Having a site search function  
* Provide a clear navigation structure  
* Allow users to customise their experience

***How can we support neurodivergent team members in a professional setting?***

	Supporting neurodivergent individuals in a professional setting is essential for the sustained success of a business. Ways to support neurodivergent team members can include:

* Building manager capability to better understand the needs and pain points of neurodivergent individuals, also allowing them to help reduce stigma and misunderstandings in the workplace to foster a more accepting environment.  
* Offering adjustments to neurodivergent individuals so that they can work to their best ability. Specific adjustments may include flexible schedules, quiet workspaces, noise-cancelling headphones, alternative communication methods, etc.  
* Sharing diversity stories can help to make people feel more welcomed and find colleagues that they can better connect with, overall creating a more positive workspace that thrives on productivity, wellbeing, and inclusivity.  
* Providing support and fostering a staff network amongst neurodivergent staff, and ensuring that they have properly allocated resources, can help to make feel neurodivergent individuals like they are more represented and considered in the organization’s decisions.  
* Making systems accessible is one of the major ways neurodivergent team members can be supported in professional settings. This may include policies, management processes, reviews, inclusion strategies, or adjusting of systems to better meet neurodivergent team members’ needs.

***How can you adjust your communication style to be more inclusive of neurodivergent users and teammates?***

	One major change I can make to my communication style to be more inclusive of other individuals would be to ensure that my messages are clearer and more easily understood. This is already something I’ve been working on in my personal life, and it has the added benefit in professional settings to make sure my words and intentions come across more clearly so as not to incur any potential misunderstandings. This would have a positive effect on my working relationships with neurodivergent individuals as well, as it makes the information much easier to process for them and allows me to more easily develop personal connections that will then in turn also increase our productivity levels.

***What are some common UX or communication pitfalls that might make Focus Bear less accessible or supportive?***

	In my research for this onboarding task, I found that neurodivergent individuals struggle with common UX or communication issues relating to busy overlays, sudden audio or video, too much text, or a lack of control and customization options. Focus Bear, as an app designed specifically for neurodivergent individuals, may encounter some of these issues, as though the app is designed with these considerations in mind, every individual is different and some may prefer more or less text or descriptions depending on their preferences. This also relates to available customization options, as some neurodivergent individuals might want to adjust themes, colors, or overlays of the app more than what is already available to customize.

***What is one practical change you can make in your work to better support vulnerable populations?***

	One practical change I can make in my work to support vulnerable populations is to work towards making my text and visuals more accessible. This may include things like alternate text options to media or breaking text into smaller blocks to make it easier to read, as I have a current habit of making messages or any text way too long, so making them shorter and more precise would make them more accessible for vulnerable populations.

***Identify one design or communication improvement that could make Focus Bear more accessible.***

	One design improvement that could make Focus Bear more accessible is an increased offering of customization options, like the option to change text or UI size or increased color variants for backgrounds and overlays, so that individuals feel a stronger sense of control over the app and can personalize it more to their liking.

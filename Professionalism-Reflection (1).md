***What are examples of professional vs. unprofessional behavior in a casual work environment?***

	**Professional Behavior**: Professional behavior in the workplace includes notions of respect, consideration, and maturity. Specific actions that show this include being punctual, dressing accordingly, communicating respectfully, being honest and ethical, being collaborative, applying your expertise, being positive, taking responsibility, and being helpful and reliable.

	**Unprofessional Behavior:** Unprofessional behavior is something to avoid in work environments, as it is often disrespectful, distracting, or inconsiderate to those around you. Examples of unprofessional behavior include personal hygiene, harassment, dressing inappropriately, gossiping about colleagues, lack of punctuality, etc. 

***What does respectful communication look like in remote teams?***

	Working remotely presents its own unique challenges relating to communication, mainly issues surrounding physical distance and timezones, operational differences and preferences between individuals, and affinity differences regarding cultural differences and familiarity. To communicate respectfully even while remote, it is best to follow a number of protocols. Firstly, to frequently check in with team members and ask them about their preferences or dislikes, and how you could adjust your own actions accordingly to better align your work with theirs. Secondly, to encourage collaboration amongst your colleagues. This could be done either through you looking for more opportunities to collaborate, or through encouraging two individuals working on similar projects to consider collaborating. Finally, another thing that could be done would be to set management standards for how teammates can communicate and collaborate respectively, making sure every individual is able to give their opinion on the standards and communicate their preferences with their team.

***How can you give and receive feedback professionally?***

	**Receiving Feedback Professionally:** When receiving feedback professionally, it is important to consider the reality of what the other person is saying without letting your emotions take control. It is easy to get flustered when someone may be correcting you for something you did wrong, but it is important to listen and understand what the other person is saying, as their feedback could make things easier for you in the long run. It is important to be open to change. Furthermore, be aware of any responses you give to your teammate, as negative responses could impact both your relationship with your colleague or your career. Once the feedback has been received, assess accordingly and reflect on whether or not you should make any adjustments– this may look like more follow up meetings, implementing suggestions, or at least trying out your coworkers idea.

	**Giving Feedback Professionally:** When giving feedback, it is essential to be respectful of the other person, and never say anything personal or that may have to do with their character– feedback is all about the actions, not the individual. It is important to balance the content of your words between positive opportunities for growth and what they did well and what they did that needs improvement. This helps limit tension and still gives the receiver positive reinforcement on what parts of their task they did well. It is important to be specific, realistic, and timely with the feedback, as all of these factors help to make the process much more professional, as unspecific, unrealistic, or delayed feedback is not very helpful to anyone.

***Have you ever experienced or witnessed great teamwork and professionalism?***

	Yes, in my work as a game developer I work very closely with one of my friends on many projects, and we often work very well together, as we are able to balance out each other's weaknesses and create finished products very quickly. We are able to give feedback, ideas, and constructive criticism quickly and professionally, allowing us to continue working well together and continuing to produce content that satisfies our users.

***What steps can you take to make sure your communication is clear, respectful, and inclusive?***

	In order to make sure my communication is clear, respectful, and inclusive, I can take better steps at clarifying the meaning of my words and the intention behind them while ensuring the other that the feedback I have is only about their actions and not about who they are as a person. This allows for a less stressful interaction for the both of us, and allows for us to quickly resolve any differences.

***How can you help create a positive, fun, and professional work environment?***

	In order to create a positive, fun, and professional work environment, what I would do would be to encourage better connection amongst team members and seek out meaningful personal connections with my colleagues. I would do this by asking them about more than just the simple conversations about what we’re working on and more about what they’ve done this week or what they plan to do over the weekend, or anything about their hobbies, friends, partners, etc. I believe developing a fun work environment centers around getting along with your colleagues on more than just a professional level.

***How can you prepare effectively for meetings with supervisors and colleagues?***

	To prepare effectively, I would create two lists. One list would be centered around the ideas I want to bring up during the meeting, and how they might be related to our current projects. Another list would be empty, but set aside for any notes I take during the meeting. 

***What would it look like to be proactive during your internship?***

	Being proactive during internships to me is all about overcommunicating. Overcommunicating allows me to know well ahead of time what certain expectations for projects are, what I could change to be in better alignment with my supervisors, or how I can ensure I’m on the right track for certain tasks before I even start.

***How might you follow up with colleagues or supervisors if you need information/action from them? How would you escalate it further if you don’t get a response, and when would you escalate?***

	Generally, I would always follow up through either any used messaging platforms like Discord, or via email, outlining what I might need from them and asking for a quick reply if possible. If I do not receive a timely reply in relation to when I need to finish a task, I would escalate it with their known supervisor or anyone else who might be able to give me input. I would only escalate if it has been a lengthy amount of time waiting for a reply (\~1 week), or when the deadline is urgent.

***What are some things you won’t do?***

I won’t be unprofessional, be disrespectful, be unhygienic, dress inappropriately, wait around for instructions, be unprepared in meetings, ghost my project, ask questions I could Google, ignore feedback, etc.

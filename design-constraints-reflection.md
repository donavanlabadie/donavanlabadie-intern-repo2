***What are common technical constraints that impact UX design?***

Common technical constraints impacting UX design include:

*  Device and operating system limitations like screen size, phone limitations, processing power, etc.  
* Accessibility constraints like voice control and screen readers.  
* Performance constraints like internet connectivity, servers, and tech stacks.  
* Integrations and APIs like external service and API requirement limitations.  
* Tech stack constraints related to front-end and back-end tech.

***How do UX designers collaborate with developers to find workable solutions?***

UX designers and developers working hand in hand is highly important for the success of both the organization and any planned updates, as UX designers generally on their own are not as equipped to be able to develop full end-to-end solutions when it comes to the implementation of their designs, as many times it requires coding or other highly technical components. Some ways UX designers can collaborate with designers include firstly actually understanding what developers do, and then frequent collaboration, keeping lines of communication open, constantly sharing deliverables, creating prototypes, ensuring smooth hand-offs, being careful about scope creep and change requests, and staying involved.

***What are best practices for simplifying complex designs without losing functionality?***

Complexity of UI/UX design at the beginning of an app is one of the ways that developers and founders can lose out on potential users, as access and understanding must be streamlined to quickly communicate value to the consumer. This includes features like fonts, colors, navigation, options, and overall feature creep. Benefits of simplified user designs include increased usability, efficiency, and accessibility. Strategies to ensure simplified designs without losing functionality include prioritizing features with user-centric designs, using progressive disclosure, implementing visual hierarchy, embracing minimalism, simplifying navigation, focusing on consistency, etc.

***How can designers advocate for usability and accessibility, even when technical limitations exist?***

Designer’s goals and ideas can often run into the problem of their concepts being technically challenging or even unfeasible to actually implement. However, there are ways to plan and solve for this from the beginning of a project. These challenges include financial limitations, coding limitations, or platform limitations. The first step towards doing this is to collaborate with developers early and frequently to understand what initial limitations would be, so that designers can plan accordingly. Following this, it is important to maximize core features, embrace platform guidelines, use design systems to maximize adaptation, and communicating realistic expectations.

***If a developer tells you a design is too complex to implement, how would you respond?***

I would firstly ask them what the reasons are, as my first goal would be to believe them, but then think of possible alternatives that would be feasible to implement. Subsequently, I would work actively with them for continued development of ideas.

***What are some non-visual factors that can impact a UX design?***

Non-visual factors that can impact a UX design include coding limitations, financial limitations, collaboration issues, unexpected cancellations or delays, or system performance.

***How can UX designers help find middle-ground solutions between ideal design and technical feasibility?***

UX designers can take feedback into account from developers and then present multiple prototypes for developer opinion, all of which factor in ideal design components. Alternatively, they can choose to only focus ont he most high-impact features that will positively improve user experience.

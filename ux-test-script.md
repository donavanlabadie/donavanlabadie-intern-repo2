**INTRODUCTION:**

Good afternoon\! Today you’ll be helping me test out a new productivity app called Focus Bear. We’re specifically looking to test the actual features of the app, and how you personally feel about the app's offerings and functionality. None of the testing is focused on you as an individual, and only about the app.

**TEST DIRECTIONS:**

To start this test, please download Focus Bear from the app store and complete the onboarding process. From there, please try to start a Focus Session. Please think aloud about what you like and dislike about anything you encounter, so that I can gather any relevant feedback, and any and all feedback is welcomed and appreciated. 

**FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS:**

* What did you like most about using the app?  
* What did you find confusing?  
* What did you not like?  
* What was easy to use?  
* What was difficult to use?

***What are the key roles in an Agile team, and what does each role do?***

	**Developer:** Not only traditional developers who may only work on the technical side, but includes other key figures like designers or writers. They are often self-organizing and able to manage problems internally within their own teams. Involvement is expected in all stages of the development process, not just technical applications, including planning, testing, and continuous integration. 

	**QA (Quality Assurance):** While in traditional project management QA is usually involved in its own stage after the developers have finished their task, in Agile QA is involved from the very beginning to ensure requirements are clear, testable, and aligned with goals. QA also tests continuously throughout the development process to ensure standards are being met.

	**Product Manager (PM)**: The product manager in an Agile team drives the development of a project, and defines the strategy, roadmap, and features. It is their job to articulate what success looks like and to rally a team behind them. Product managers sit at the cross section of UX, technology, and business. Their responsibilities include understanding users, prioritizing features, aligning stakeholders, and driving product vision. They work closely with all other major teams.

	**Agile Product Manager (Agile PM):** Agile product managers are also commonly referred to as the Product Owner. This is the other key role in Agile teams alongside product managers and developers. They are responsible for setting clear, achievable goals for each sprint, managing and prioritizing the backlog, working with both other team members and stakeholders.

	**Other supporting roles:** For other roles, like UX, the role is to better connect the team with the customer through research and first-hand experience, identifying customer needs and pain points. Customer support roles play a similar role, working directly with customers for critical feedback, and then communicating their findings to the rest of the team. For roles like Stakeholders, which includes anyone outside the team that is affected by the product and its success, their experience and needs is what guides decisions, and is what the UX team works with directly. 

***How do these roles collaborate in Kanban vs. Scrum?***

	**Kanban:** The key roles of Agile collaborate in Kanban through the visualized Kanban board, where members have responsibility for handling parts of the board they are involved with. The visualization also makes it easier for teams to collaborate, as they are able to quickly input and identify new information that they can then share their ideas about and ask their colleagues about. A main factor of how members collaborate in Kanban is that their work is continuous, with fast feedback and limited works in progress.

	**Scrum:** Unlike Kanban, work is more structured and follows the four major ceremonies. This results in lesser cross-role collaboration and communication compared to teams working in Kanban, who work flexibly and fluidly with the pace of work.

***What is your role, and how does it contribute to the Agile process?***

	My role is Content Strategy, which falls under the category of Marketing in the Agile process. In Agile, marketing emphasizes frequent releases, experimentation, customer focus, and customer feedback through the use of data, iterative planning, and transparency with both consumers and peers. The nature of marketing and content strategy is always evolving, and this aligns closely with the Agile strategy that requires flexibility and continuous development and change, thus the information I gather and the content I produce on the marketing front is inherently valuable to other members of the Agile process.

***How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles in the team?***

	Because marketing involves data collection and the realization of ideas, the content I collect and produce has a value to other members of the team, as consolidated ideas and discovered trends provide valuable insights to members of the Agile team like developers, who are designing new products and features in line with these trends and consumer needs. Marketing also works closely with other user-focused roles like customer support and UX, whose user insights are also equally valuable to the content I will produce.

***Write a short description of how your role fits into the Agile team.***

	The role of content strategy is both an intake and an output in the Agile team. The intake occurs from insights and data collected by other team members focusing on user experience feedback, like UX and customer support, and using them to align content that connects best to our users and opening the door at finding new users that can benefit from the app. The output occurs from the research I do on my own to produce the content of my articles and content, which is valuable to all other members of the team, who might be able to connect the trends I discover to the features, products, or ideas they produce, as it might highlight ideas or components they hadn’t previously realized.

***Identify one other role you frequently collaborate with and describe how you can improve teamwork with them.***

	One role I would frequently collaborate with would be the UX team. UX works directly with customer feedback, information that is invaluable to the work I myself am producing, and the research I conduct is also valuable to them, as insights could help with the way they direct or develop features to better meet the needs of our customers, including needs that our customers have not yet realized they had. Improved teamwork with the UX team could be more intentionally reaching out to members on the team and discussing any findings either of us have had, which would enable either of us to potentially gain insights that we can then apply to our work.

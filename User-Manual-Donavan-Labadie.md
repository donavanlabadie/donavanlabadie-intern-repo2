***What is a “User Manual for Me”, and why do teams use them?***

	User Manuals are a quick, easy to digest and understand document that consolidates the major working habits and preferences of any one individual for other employees to quickly better understand their likes, dislikes, and how they can better collaborate. Teams use them to help facilitate getting teams comfortable around each other and to expedite the introductory processes, especially for new members on the teams or new teams in general. Additionally, it allows for people to identify what other individuals in a team they might work best with, helping them develop strong and reliable partnerships through the course of their employment.

***What categories are helpful to include?***

	Categories that are helpful to include are things like preferences for working conditions, working hours, communication preferences, preferred means of feedback, needs, struggles, likes, dislikes, and other miscellaneous facts. All of these allow team members to get a quick snapshot into who you are that enables them to more readily work and excel with you.

***How can writing a personal user manual improve teamwork and reduce misunderstandings?***

	Writing a personal user manual helps to avoid any miscommunications that might derive from differing communication strategies, working hours, working conditions, or personal preferences. This helps for team members to understand when you might be available and how best you prefer to work, allowing them to meet you there instead of the both of you having to figure it out through what could be difficult initial interactions where either person could make poor initial assumptions about the other. This helps to start work relationships off on the right foot. Getting to know more things about one another also helps connect both people and allows them to find potentially common interests outside of work.

***What do you need from teammates to do your best work?***

	Constructive criticism, communication, and compromise are the three main pillars to how I prefer to work with teammates. Detailed instructions are also appreciated as a smaller, fourth category, but I prefer to work directly and efficiently with teammates while also communicating both about work and personal matters. Getting to know my teammates personally as well as professionally is highly important for my work, as I find I work much quicker and deliver much higher quality when I have developed genuine, meaningful bonds with those I am working alongside.

***How do you prefer to communicate?***

	I prefer to communicate with teammates through either async messages or quick, check-in calls. I find it to be the most efficient for getting work done, especially remotely. Though, I do enjoy longer call discussions when needed for big team meetings, rehearsals, or major development stages.

***What helps you stay focused and productive?***

	I generally focus best when in a public space, regardless of noise levels, as being around other people generally just causes me to be more productive. Though, I am still able to get work done at home when listening to music or following structured to-do lists.

***How do you like to give and receive feedback?***

	I mainly prefer to give and receive feedback through constructive criticism with some elements of positive reinforcement. I appreciate people being up front about the quality of my work, and I prefer to do the same, as I believe it is the most efficient and quickest way to resolution and improvement. 

***What are some quirks or things to know about your work style?***

	I can be very unorthodox with my practices, ideas, and implementation. I am usually known for being quite outside the box with my thinking pattern and ideas. In my experience as a game developer, I was often innovating and coming up with radical new ideas that would increase player enjoyment and user experience levels as high as possible, and I wouldn’t give up on an idea until I was either sure it was impossible or until I had found some new way to implement the solution. I believe in pushing the boundaries on what people believe to be possible in traditional spaces where others may just recycle and reuse the same patterns and ideas as others. Additionally, I prefer to visualize my production process where possible, as it is much easier for me to generate content when it is something I can see versus only an idea I have in mind.

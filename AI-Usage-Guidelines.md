***What AI tools are typically used for your role?***

	Many AI tools can be used for Content Strategy because the role includes so many different aspects, including research, creation, optimization, distribution, and analytics. Different platforms like ChatGPT, Surfer SEO, or Moz’s Keyword Explorer can be used to help facilitate the search and discovery process when it comes to producing content and writing articles. AI tools are also able to suggest things like edits or synonyms to work that has already been produced for minor tweaking. The use of AI tools in content strategy is primarily time and resource costs.

***What are the benefits and risks of using AI in a professional setting?***

	The main benefit of using AI powered tools in a professional setting relates most to cost and time improvements. When AI is reliable, the time and money it saves through use is invaluable to any employee, as they are then able to dedicate these resources into other critical tasks. It can also facilitate the analysis or compiling of data where needed, and is good at quickly giving insights relating to it.

	Risks of AI come from unreliability, potential costs for internal implementation, overreliance, or decreased motivation and efficiency from employees. AI comes with many inherent risks that users must be diligent about maintaining, as blindly trusting everything that AI produces could result in an incorrect or suboptimal finished product. All content produced by AI must be fact-checked and verified for its accuracy and reliability for use in a finished product. Other employees may get lost in the allure of AI programs essentially doing their job for them, but in reality this could greatly impact the efficiency and functionality of the organization. Additionally, if a company were to develop their own AI tool, then the costs for implementation and capable functionality may quickly outweigh the potential reduced costs in labor.

***What types of information should never be entered into AI tools?***

	Any information critical to an individual’s personal life or their organization must never be entered into AI tools, as it otherwise risks data breaches, as public AI can store and reuse what users enter. This encompasses things like credit card information, bank statements, legal proceedings, company technology or code, employee names, addresses, relationships, etc.

***How can you fact-check and validate AI-generated content to ensure accuracy?***

	In order to fact-check and validate AI-generated content, users can ask the AI themselves to supply links to where it has sourced information from, and then they can manually fact-check the source, or they can search independently after the AI has produced a result to guarantee the accuracy of the statement. Multiple, accurate and reliable sources are essential for validating AI-generated content, as some models are prone to producing incorrect information.

***When should you use AI for assistance, and when should you rely on your own skills?***

	AI should be used as a supplement and not a replacement to your own work and capabilities. AI is helpful for brainstorming, researching, summarizing, and checking things like grammar, but should not be producing final content. It is essential to utilize your own skills when doing things like writing articles or code, developing new features, or final reviewing, this ensures that only the top quality of content is being sent to customers, and they also have the added bonus of knowing the content they are consuming is coming from a real person and not an AI tool.

***How can you avoid over-reliance on AI while still benefiting from it?***

	You can avoid over-reliance on AI by ensuring its use is strictly retained only to auxiliary parts of any development process like brainstorming or research, and not when it comes to producing final content or critically developing ideas. This ensures that AI is still beneficial while retaining and sharpening critical thinking skills and overall intelligence as you work to solve new and complex tasks that stimulate your thinking.

***What steps will you take to ensure data privacy when using AI tools?***

	To ensure data privacy when using AI tools, I will only give it the minimum information needed to complete a task, and will not give it any sensitive information or potentially contextual knowledge about the company I work for.

***Identify one task you can improve using an AI tool, and try it out.***

	One task I can improve with an AI tool is research and keyword searching. For this I used ChatGPT, who was able to find relevant articles to my topic search and provide me with links that I could then fact-check and validate while also doing my own verification. ChatGPT was also able to consolidate the overall theme across multiple articles, making it easier for me to begin working on the next step of the process, which would be rough drafting and brainstorming.

***Review the AI-generated output critically–did it require editing or fact-checking?***

	Yes, it required fact-checking. As a best-use practice when using AI tools, I always make sure to fact-check the information before using it for anything else. Editing of the content is less important to me, as I generally will always rewrite the content it produces after I’ve fact-checked and gained additional individual opinions.

***Document one best practice you will follow when using AI tools at Focus Bear.***

	One best practice I will follow when using AI tools at Focus Bear is to continue only using AI for auxiliary tasks and not for the critical development of any information or final content. All content I write and produce will be my own individual work without overreliance on AI, as I believe the AI writing style to have a distinct alien feeling that is easy to pick up on in longer form articles.

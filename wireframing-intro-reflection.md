***What is a wireframe, and how does it differ from a prototype?***

A wireframe is a simplified, static, and structural blueprint of a website or application. It’s a visual representation that outlines only the key elements of a design, like layout, functionality, and spacing. It is a crucial communication tool, allowing designers and stakeholders to easily visualize a product before engaging in detailed design work, and is typically the first step in a design process. A prototype, however, is the preliminary version or sample of a final product that designers use to test and refine before the final launch. The key differences are at what stages they both occur during the design process– wireframing is at the very beginning, and prototyping occurs later, as an early draft of what will eventually become the final design.

***What are the key differences between low-fidelity and high-fidelity wireframes?***

The primary difference between low-fidelity and high-fidelity wireframes is the amount of detail. Low-fi focuses on basic sketches and layouts without any detailed elements– mostly everything is a placeholder. On the other hand, high-fidelity wireframes are highly polished and detailed, closely resembling what will eventually be the final product. They include all necessary visual information and interactive elements.

***When should wireframes be used in the UX design process?***

Wireframes should be used both early and throughout the UX design process, but especially in the conceptual phase at the beginning of the project where they are most useful, allowing designers to sketch early ideas and easily gather relevant feedback. 

***How do wireframes improve collaboration between UX, PMs, and developers?***

Wireframes naturally encourage communication and collaboration between UX, PMs, and developers in its existence as a standard, early blueprint that works best when collaborating on to develop the intended structure and functionality. Wireframes give team members a means of communicating their thoughts and ideas for what they like, dislike, or think may or may not be technically feasible when a new concept is being considered.

***What are the benefits of starting with wireframes rather than jumping into high-fidelity design?***

Starting with wireframes, rather than jumping straight into high-fidelity work, enables teams to essentially consider anything and everything they might want to include in the design process, allowing them to craft hypotheses and see what might work best for meeting user needs. They allow for quick changes that benefit from feedback and comments made by other team members or stakeholders about what they believe to be most beneficial for the application or website.

***How can wireframes help identify usability issues early?***

Wireframes allow teams to look at the skeleton and consider realistic implementation of features before it reaches a point where changes become too resource intensive. By only focusing on the core functionality of the feature(s), teams are able to easily pinpoint where critical actions must occur, and if there would be any usability issues relating to them that they need to fix before moving onto more high-fidelity designs.

***If a stakeholder asks for a high-fidelity design too soon, how would you explain the value of wireframing?***

I would explain the value of wireframing through its cost efficiency and quick turnaround capabilities. Wireframing is fundamental to the design process in how it enables teams to spend little resources to make quick adjustments and quickly draft up conceptual pieces for how they may want a final feature to look or function. In doing so, it allows teams to go over all the potential risks and rewards from only the core aspects of the feature to ensure that implementation would be smooth and that it would generate a positive user experience.
